# CloudScriber

Built in python using open source neural language modeling, CloudScriber takes a simple YouTube URL and automatically outputs an audio-to-text transcription of the video. In addition, the program generates a custom-masked wordcloud to aid in visualizing word frequency in the subject material. 

CloudScriber leverages OpenAI's latest Whisper automatic speech recognition model to generate text from audio at a level approaching human accuracy (with English, at least). Visuals are produced using matplotlib and the wordcloud library. Stunning colors are rendered using the latest Viridis color palettes. 

Lightweight yet powerful, this program generates accurate and aesthetically pleasing results with remarkable simplicity and ease. 



Further features will include a visual interface built in gradio as well as various visualization improvements. 




I would love any questions, comments, or feedback you may have and look forward to seeing what you create :) 

Happy visualizing!
